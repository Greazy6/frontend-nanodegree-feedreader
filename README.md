Project 6

This is my project 6 where I have used Jasmine to run som tests.

To run this application please fork these files from my github page Greazy6 named frontend-nanodegree-feedreader and clone the file to your hard drive.

Then open index.html file.

Jasmine will run a series of test to ensure that the application is working well.

Once Jasmine is done you will see there are no errors, because it will be displayed on the page
